# Basic Network Sniffer  

This is my first internship project with **Code Alpha**, where I built a simple **Network Sniffer in Python**.  
The tool captures and analyzes network packets on a Windows machine.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Packet Capture** â€“ Captures live network packets using Pythonâ€™s socket library.  
- **Source & Destination Info** â€“ Displays IP addresses and protocol details.  
- **Payload Display** â€“ Shows packet data in readable form.  
- **Stop Anytime** â€“ Sniffer can be stopped with `Ctrl + C`.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.13** (Windows 10/11)  
- **Socket Library** (for raw packet sniffing)  
- *(Optional)* **Scapy** (for advanced packet analysis)
